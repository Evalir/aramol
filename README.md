# Pokegon

If you follow DAOs, you know exactly what this is... [A Pokemol clone!](https://pokemol.com/) Made for both learning purposes, and to test very early versions of [Aragon Connect](https://connect.aragon.org/).

Since its inception, we've shifted to codesandbox & examples included in the Connect repo. As of result, this is no longer maintained.

Huge props to the Pokemol / DaoHaus team; Pokegon draws its inspiration from them.
